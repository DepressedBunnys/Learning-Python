# Basic Data types
# String = plain text EG. "Hello"
# Numbers = number EG. 50, 50.90
# Boolean = true/false value EG. is_female = True/False

#Creating variables
character_name = "John" #Character name has the value John
character_age = 35
print("There was once a man named " + character_name + ", ") #Adding the character name to the string
print("he was " + character_age + " years old. ")

character_name = "Tom" #Giving a different value to the character name variable
character_age = 50
print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ", ")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")
